# edd-recursive-doc-agent-vs-metadata-replacement
Applying Evaluation Driven Development (EDD) to aid in the design decision of RAG pipelines. Specifically, this repo demonstrates how to use EDD to decide which of these two strategies perform best for a multi document RAG pipeline:

* Recursive retriever + document agent
* Metadata replacement + node sentence window

See Colab notebook for detailed implementation.
